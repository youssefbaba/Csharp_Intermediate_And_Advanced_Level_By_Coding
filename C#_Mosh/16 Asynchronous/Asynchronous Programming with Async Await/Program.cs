             - Synchronous Program Execution and Asynchronous¨Program Execution
                - Synchronous Program Execution :
                    - Program is Executed line by line , one at time.
                    - When a function is called , program execution has to wait until the function returns before it continues execution to the next line
                        - Line1; 
                        - CalledFunction();   3 second for execution , we must wait until the function returns
                        - Line3;
                        - Line4;
                - Asynchronous Program Execution :
                    - When a function is called, program execution continues to the next line , without waiting for the function to complete.
             - Asynchronous programming model improves responsiveness of your application
