         - Array : Capable of storing multiple values
            - Fixed length : We cannot increase/decrease the size of an array.
            - We cannot insert values into the middle of an array.
            - We cannot delete or remove values from the middle of an array.           

         - Collections = Dynamic array : Capable of storing multiple values
            - Variable length : We can increase/decrease the size of the collection (Auto resizing).
            - We can insert values into the middle of the collection.
            - We can delete or remove values from the middle of the collection.
            - There are two types of Collections :
                - Generic Collections : List<TValue> , Dictionary<TKey,TValue> , Stack<TValue> , Queue<TValue> ...
                - Non-Generic Collections : ArrayList , Hashtable  , Stack , Queue ... 

         - The difference between an Array and ArrayList :
                - Array                                     - ArrayList
                   - Fixed Length                               - Variable Length (Auto resizing)
                   - Not possible to insert items               - We can insert items into the middle
                   - Not possible to delete items               - We can delete items from the middle
                   - Type safe                                  - Not type safe
                   - Both are going to store the value          - Both are going to store the value 
                     in the index patern.                         in the index patern.
